<h1>The Best Movies According to Rob</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>A classic, enough said.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>My first favorite and will always be.</p>

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>A simple yet moving film about persuasion and sticking to the facts. To add, I've seen a live performance of this film!</p>

<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>The wild west, thrilling and a strong story. A slow burner that culminates in one of my favorite scenes ever.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>A story that you cannot predict! Each time I see this movie I am again struck at how much thought was put into the dialogue and pacing.</p>
